//pointer
//push_back function - used to add an element at the end of the vector
//a_ptr->push_back(100);
//(*a_ptr).push_back(100);
//cout<<(*a_ptr)<<endl;
//long number = 10;
//long *p_number = &number;
//or you can simply do 
//new operator - is used to allocate memory dynamically
//three things new operator does is 
//int* ptr = new int(6);
//cout<<*ptr<<endl;//if we will not use * address will be printed.
//1. allocates memory
//2. returns the address of allocated memory
//3. calls the constructor to initialize the memory (if applicable)
//class - blueprint of an object
//public- members are accessible from outside the class
//private- members are not accessible from outside the class
//protected- members are accessible in derived class
//difference between passing by refernce and psasing by value
//passing by value - a copy of the actual parameter is passed to the function
//passing by reference - a reference to the actual parameter is passed to the function
